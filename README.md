# Interview Prep Kit

In this prep kit, we have a series of general algorithm practice questions, and general React practice problems.

In the [Fundamentals](./Fundamentals/README.md) folder, upon `cd`ing into it you'll need to run `npm install` in order to get `jest` - the testing library - installed, unless you don't want to validate the results. If you're ready to check your solutions, you can run `npm run test` while in the Fundamentals folder to validate all solutions, or if you'd like to check just one solution at a time, `npm run test -- <filename.test.js>` (ex: `npm run test -- vowel-count.test.js`)

In the [React](./React/README.md) folder, each problem will be a distinct project that you'll need to individually run `npm install` in, and each project will have its own README with additional details about setup and testing.
