function fibonacci(digits) {
    // For this, you are tasked with finding the Fibonacci series from the first digit until the nth digit in the series.
    // The nth digit that you will be stopping at is given by the integer variable `digits`
    // The Fibonacci series starts with 0 as the first digit, and 1 as the second digit.
    // Each successive number is a sum of the previous two numbers
    // The third digit is 1 (0+1), the fourth digit is 2 (1+1), the fifth digit is 3 (1+2)
    // You will be returning an array of the numbers in the series
    // Example: the digits variable you are given has a value of 10
    // 0 and 1 are given as the first two, and you will end up returning [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
