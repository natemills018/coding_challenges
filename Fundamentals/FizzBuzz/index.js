function fizzBuzz(stopNum) {
    let arr = [];
    /*
        Create a for loop iterating from 1 to the stopNum.
        You will be returning an array of integers and strings.   
        
        If the number is evenly divisble by 2, push "Cake" into the array.
        If the number is evenly divisble by 5, push "Pie" into the array.
        If the number is evenly divisble by BOTH 2 and 5, push "CakeAndPie" into the array.

        Example return value - if stopNum is 10, the resulting output is:
        [1, "Cake", 3, "Cake", "Pie", "Cake", 7, "Cake", 9, "CakeAndPie"]
